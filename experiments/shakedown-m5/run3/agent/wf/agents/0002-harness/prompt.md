Write a baseline harness from "/home/hal/dev/interp/metis/experiments/shakedown-m5/run3/agent/intake"/*.
Never read experiments/, operator/, or control/. Write only under "/home/hal/dev/interp/metis/experiments/shakedown-m5/run3/agent/harness".
The operator already started the dev box. Do not start, stop, or access it; the pipeline runs your scripts.
Run the published build and binary and read measurements from its OUTPUT. Never parse or assert on source text. Measurement checks must fail only on missing or invalid output; the pipeline scores measured values against anchors.

Use the probe's discovered paths and versions. Never hard-code a toolkit path the probe did not find, even if the brief suggests one. If a required tool is missing, install it with apt only from sources the probe lists; do not add repositories or assume a package exists. Commented source lines are not enabled repositories. If apt cannot supply it, use pip for cmake only; otherwise fail with a clear message.
Write three self-contained bash scripts, invoked from a shared remote working directory with bash harness/<name>:
- setup.sh: build/install the published baseline at its exact intake pin in the stock image. Use sudo only for apt. Preserve stock torch and published source/configuration. Stage source in baseline-published/ and inputs in data/. Do not silently substitute or tune the baseline. Make setup safe to retry once in this directory.
- run_anchors.sh: run the published anchor protocol at the real representative scale declared in EXECUTION.json. Write out/anchors_measured.json as {anchor_id: measured_number}, one finite number per intake anchor. Never copy published values as measurements.
- profile.sh: run that same baseline once at representative scale, with stage wall timers and nvidia-smi sampling. Write out/profile/stages.json as [{stage, wall_s, gpu_s}] (finite nonnegative seconds, gpu_s null when unavailable), and out/profile/total_wall_s.json as {total_wall_s} (finite positive seconds). Save raw telemetry under out/profile/. Use critical-path stage wall times without double-counting overlap. Do not invent GPU timings or replace unavailable GPU timings with allocated time.
Create output directories, preserve logs, and exit nonzero on failure. Read all intake files for pins, commands, data, scale and protocol. Do not run builds or workloads locally.
Return a short completion acknowledgement; the pipeline reads the scripts itself.
