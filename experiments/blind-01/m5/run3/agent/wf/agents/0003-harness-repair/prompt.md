setup.sh failed (rc 1). Repair only "/home/hal/dev/interp/metis/experiments/blind-01/m5/run3/agent/harness/setup.sh" using intake evidence. Preserve the published pin, configuration and stock image; sudo only for apt. Scope: setup.sh builds and checks only the baseline. The pipeline owns profiling and profiler installation; do not write profile.sh or install profiling tools. A setup repair may change only setup.sh; an anchors repair may change run_anchors.sh, run_command.sh, or both, and nothing else. Stay within each script's scope. Run the published build and binary and read measurements from its OUTPUT. run_command.sh contains only the exact measured baseline command and complete environment at the representative scale. run_command.sh is the canonical measured command and complete environment, including working directory, arguments, CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES and GPU count. run_command.sh must use paths relative to its working directory, never absolute paths into the run directory, and write only under out/ or temporary files. Concurrency and evaluation run it from sibling work directories linking the same trees. The pipeline owns CUDA MPS. No harness script (setup.sh, run_anchors.sh, run_command.sh, run_evaluation.sh) may set, unset or override any CUDA_MPS_* environment variable, or start or stop an MPS daemon; inherit these variables unchanged. run_anchors.sh must invoke bash harness/run_command.sh without overriding its environment or duplicating the workload command; parse its saved output for every intake item ID, anchors and references. With an empty anchors.json, still run the published command and write out/anchors_measured.json as {}. The fixed profiler invokes that identical file with bash from the same working directory. Keep output paths stable and preserve logs. Every later run script must preserve the published configuration. Validate printed configuration against the actual command and environment. Preserve consistency in repairs; read the other harness scripts while editing only the permitted scripts. Never parse or assert on source text. Measurement checks must fail only on missing or invalid output; the pipeline scores measured values against anchors. Never read experiments/, operator/, or control/. Do not run workloads locally or access the box. This is the only repair attempt for this script.
Budget: 1200s; measured elapsed: 92s; measured overrun: 0s. Script budgets in seconds: setup.sh=1200, run_anchors.sh=1200, fixed profiler=1200, run_evaluation.sh=1200 per invocation (also run_anchors.sh when used as the evaluation adapter); complete evaluation scorer=2400. Use one fixed scale from EXECUTION.json, no scale search or doubling loops, and finish well within the budget.

Use the probe's discovered paths and versions. Accept either a complete CUDA toolkit root containing bin/nvcc, include/cuda_runtime.h and lib64/libcudart.so, or the distro layout with /usr/bin/nvcc, /usr/include/cuda_runtime.h and libcudart.so under /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu. Have the scripts check all three selected paths with ls on the box. Prefer a complete toolkit root when both layouts exist; otherwise accept the complete distro layout without requiring /usr/lib64/libcudart.so. Use the same selected compiler, include and library paths in every script, including repairs. For a complete root, pass it explicitly via CUDAToolkit_ROOT or -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=<root>/bin/nvcc and prepend <root>/bin to PATH. For the distro layout, use /usr/bin/nvcc with its distro include and library paths explicitly; do not treat /usr as a toolkit root requiring lib64. Never rely on /usr/bin/nvcc when a complete toolkit root exists. Never hard-code a toolkit path the probe did not find, even if the brief suggests one. If a required tool is missing, install it with apt only from sources the probe lists; do not add repositories or assume a package exists. Commented source lines are not enabled repositories. If apt cannot supply it, use pip for cmake only; otherwise fail with a clear message.
